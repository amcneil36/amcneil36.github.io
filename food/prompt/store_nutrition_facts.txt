I have images of various food that I eat. Here are all of the URLS:
-https://amcneil36.github.io/food/images/almonds.png
-https://amcneil36.github.io/food/images/pistachios.png

Navigate to those links and create a JSON of each food. Have the JSON in this format:

-food_name: string
-serving_size: int
-serving_size_unit_type: string
-nutrients: map of string to float (includes stuff like calories, protein, total sugar, added sugar, calcium, etc)
-ingredients: list of string
-notes: string (any additional notes that are important that don't fit in other sections. For example, this section could indicate that the egg is cage free. This field is optional)

After creating JSON for each food, then give me one JSON that combines all of the JSON

Let me know if you fail to read any of the provided images.
