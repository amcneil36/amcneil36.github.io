I have images of various food that I eat. Here are all of the URLS:
-https://amcneil36.github.io/food/images/almonds.png
-https://amcneil36.github.io/food/images/pistachios.png

Navigate to those links and create a JSON of each food. Have the JSON in this format:

-food_name: string
-serving_size: int
-serving_size_unit_type: string
-nutrients: map of string to float (includes stuff like calories, protein, total sugar, added sugar, calcium, etc)
-ingredients: list of string
-notes: string (any additional notes that are important that don't fit in other sections. For example, this section could indicate that the egg is cage free. This field is optional)

If you fail to read any of the provided images, tell me in your response which URLs you failed to read and don't tell me anything else in your response.

If you have successfully generated the JSON, then I want your response to only be the combined JSON and nothing else.
