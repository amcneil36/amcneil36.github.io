## Technical Debt Recommendations
Technical debt is any shortcut that a team chooses to do now that will impede future development if left undone.<sup>1</sup> Some people generally prefer to tackle technical debt by scheduling periods of time where the only focus is to tackle technical debt. Others will take a different approach where they only tackle technical debt if it will help out the current task they are working on. Dealing with technical debt is a conversation that needs to be had between software engineers and business people. I'll give my recommendations for how to go about tackling technical debt as well as how software engineers and business people can communicate together to come up with a plan for tackling technical debt.
