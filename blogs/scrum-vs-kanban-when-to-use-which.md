## Scrum vs Kanban: When to use which?
Scrum and Kanban are two popular frameworks that some of the software development teams out there use. Scrum is currently used a little bit more than Kanban in software development but that does not necessarily mean that Scrum is inherently better than Kanban. There are some scenarios in which Scrum is the better fit for a development team and some scenarios in which Kanban is the better fit for the development team. In this blog post we will cover which scenarios I feel Scrum makes more sense and which scenarios I feel that Kanban makes more sense.

### The key differences between Scrum and Kanban that will be used to help determine which one to use
Scrum has sprints whereas Kanban does not. Scrum has this concept of timeboxing and optimizing the product for getting feedback at the end of the sprint. Kanban tends to focus more on releases. So when determining which framework to use, the most important question to ask is: should our team optimize our product for getting feedback at demos in fixed  2-4 week intervals?
