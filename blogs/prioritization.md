## Prioritization

Suppose you are on a team that is working on a product. Let's say that your team has a backlog of user stories. How does your team determine which user story to work on next?

The prioritization is done by the product owner. The product owner has the domain knowledge and understands the business value that each user story gives. One thing the product owner might do is to take each user story and assign points to each story based on business value. Perhaps one user story is considered a 5 business value points and another user story is 10 business value points. This would mean that the user story that is 10 business value points is twice as valuable as the 5.
