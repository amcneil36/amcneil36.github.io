## Prioritization

Suppose you are on a team that is working on a product. Let's say that your team has a backlog of user stories. How does your team determine which user story to work on next?

The prioritization is done by the product owner. The product owner has the domain knowledge and understands the business value that each user story gives. One thing the product owner might do is to take each user story and assign points to each story based on business value. Perhaps one user story is considered a 5 business value points and another user story is 10 business value points. This would mean that the user story that is 10 business value points is twice as valuable as the 5. The product owner could then look at each user story and prioritize based on which user stories have the highest business value points.

There are some problems with this. One problem is that some of these user stories might not actually add any value alone. User stories should be broken down very small such that you can complete multiple of them in a sprint. Each user story adds a small amount of functionality. But it can be the case that this small amount of functionality alone is not useful to the customer unless another small amount of functionality is also added.
