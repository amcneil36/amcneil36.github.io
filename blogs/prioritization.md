## Prioritization

Suppose you are on a team that is working on a product. Let's say that your team has a backlog of user stories. The team needs to have some technique for prioritizing which user stories will be done in which order. This prioritization is done by the product owner because the product owner. How does the product owner do this prioritization?

The prioritization is done by the product owner. The product owner has the domain knowledge and understands the business value that each user story gives. One thing the product owner might do is to take each user story and assign points to each story based on business value. Perhaps one user story is considered a 5 business value points and another user story is 10 business value points. This would mean that the user story that is 10 business value points is twice as valuable as the 5. The product owner could then look at each user story and prioritize based on which user stories have the highest business value points.

There are some problems with this. One problem is that some of these user stories might not actually add any value alone. User stories should be broken down very small such that you can complete multiple of them in a sprint. Each user story adds a small amount of functionality. But it can be the case that this small amount of functionality alone is not useful to the customer unless another small amount of functionality is also added. Suppose user story A cannot add business value unless user story B is also done and vice versa. Neither of these user stories individually add business value so it doesn't make sense to put business value points on these. We also want to make sure that when we are prioritzing, we do user stories A and B consecutively. What we can do here is place the business value points at the epic level. Perhaps there is an epic that contains user stories A and B. When putting the business value points at the epic level, we now have something that independently adds value. We can then choose when to work on the epic. Once we get around to working on the epic, we can do user stories A and B consecutively. 

Now, the product owner is able to look at the business value points of the work that needs to be able to be done. The product owner could go off of these business value points to determine which work to work on in which order. However, going off of business value points alone is not enough information
