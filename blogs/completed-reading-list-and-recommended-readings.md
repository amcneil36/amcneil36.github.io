## Completed Reading List and Recommended Readings
In this post I am keeping track of all the books I have read and am documenting which of these books I feel are the best books to read for people who are working in software development. I started keeping track of these books in 2019 so I haven't included any books that I read prior to then. Most of these books will be specific to software development. The remaining books will be on topics that are indirectly useful for software development like professionalism, presentation skills, social skills, etc. If I read any book that is not beneficial to software development, I will not include it on this list. Some of these books will only be relevant to software engineers and others will be relevant to all people on a software development team.

### Recommended Readings
This list will be sorted from best to worst in terms of how much I recommend reading it. That being said, any book that makes this list is terrific. Many of the books that did not make this list were also very good but I wanted to keep this list small because throwing too many books at people might discourage them. 

#### 1. Fowler, Martin and Beck, Kent. Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code. Addison-Wesley, 1999.
My favorite part about this book is that it talks about when to refactor code and when to leave it alone. I have worked on projects in the past where I later realized I made sub-optimal design decisions and was wondering when or if it would ever be appropriate to refactor the code I had written. This book is also very good at explaining different refactorings that can be done to improve the quality of the code. This book has helped my software development career more than any other book that I have read.

#### 2. Martin, Robert. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Prentice Hall, 2009.
This book helped me write code that is easier to read. It communicated the important of explaining yourself in code. It talks about how to document your code and where to document your code. It talks about setting up your code to follow the single responsibility principle. This book was written in a way that is easy for beginners to understand. I think all software engineers should read this book early in their career.

#### 3. Rubin, Kenneth. Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide To The Most Popular Agile Process. Addison-Wesley, 2013.
I have read a couple different books on scrum but this was the most complete one. This book goes really far in-depth on scrum. It talks about all of the recurring scrum meetings and what to do in the meetings. This book also talks about the various roles on the scrum team. You don't have to read multiple books on scrum. You can get everything you need to know about scrum from this book. You do not have to be a software engineer to read this book. Anyone on a scrum team can benefit from reading this book.

#### 4. Humble, Jez and Farley, David. Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test And Deployment Automation. Addison-Wesley, 2010.
Despite the title not mentioning continuous integration, this book is heavy on continuous integration (in addition to continuous delivery). This was the most in-depth and complete book on continuous integration and continuous delivery that I have read. This book is written in a way that is language and technology independent so anyone wanting to learn about ci/cd could read it. This book talks about various stages of the deployment pipeline and what goes into doing a release. It talks heavily about what all should happen when a ci-server builds your project. This book also talks a lot about recommended practices for all different types of automated tests. It also talks about recommended branching strategies for version control which is a very interesting subject that every team needs to decide how they want to handle.

#### 5. Cohn, Mike. Agile Estimation and Planning. Pearson Education, 2006.
This is a book that anyone on a development team could read. I would not say that it has everything that you need to know about estimation and planning. I would recommend reading multiple books on estimation and planning. However, I consider this to be the best book on estimation and planning that I have read. This book talks about how to plan your sprints as well as how to plan your releases. It also talks about different ways to estimate, including a comparison of story points versus ideal days.  Mike Cohn is one of the original contributors to the scrum framework and really knows his stuff.

#### 6. Carnegie, Dale. How To Win Friends and Influence People. 1936.
This is one of those books that will indrectly help anyone who is working in software development. In fact, it will pretty much help anyone in any industry. It mentions ways to talk to people in such a way that will make it easier to become friends with people. I think that a lot of software engineers struggle with communication skills and I think this book makes a lot of great points that they could benefit from. Having effective communication skills can allow for a team to be significantly more productive.

#### 7. Beck, Kent. Test-Driven Development By Example. Addison-Wesley, 2003.
Kent Beck is considered to be the founder of test driven development. So who better to read a book on TDD from than him? This book contains a lot of high quality information on how to use TDD. It includes writing test scenarios, choosing which scenarios to test first, and different strategies for making a test pass. The only downside of this book is that it is primarily just talking about using TDD for unit testing and does not cover Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). That is OK though because there is a book on this list that covers ATDD.

#### 8. Freeman, Steve. Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests. Addison-Wesley, 2012.
This has some overlap with Kent Beck's TDD book in that it also talks about TDD for unit tests. However, this book also talks about using TDD for acceptance tests (ATDD). It talks about combining TDD for unit tests and acceptance tests in something referred to as 'double loop TDD.' I felt that this book did a very good job explaining how to come up with acceptance test cases and strategies for making the acceptance tests pass. 

#### 9. Craig Larman and Bas Vodde. Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Large, Multisite, and Offshore Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum. Addison-Wesley, 2012.
This book talks about large scale software development which is something that there is not a lot of books on. It talks about effective ways to take large organizations that have many teams working on the same product and maximize the amount of value delivered. It talks about taking a large feature and breaking it down to smaller features and assigning features to feature teams. It also talks about cross-team dependencies and when to combine sprint retros/sprint reviews with other teams. It also talks about how many people of which role there need to be.

#### 10. Catlin, Karen. Vijayashanker, Poornima. Present! A techies guide to public speaking. 2015.
This book would be good for anyone who wants to improve their public speaking skills. It talks about how to make a presentation and how to prepare for your presentation. Many people can become nervous prior to giving a presentation so this book also presents some ways to calm you down. My favorite aspect of this book is that they try to get you in the mindset of having your presentation being a conversation with your audience. You can present that information you have researched and then talk with people in the audience during the Q&A session about the topics you discussed. It creates for a greate learning opportunity. Reading this book changed the way I viewed presentations. I now view presentations as a fun opportunity to talk with others about topics that interest me.
