# Feature Teams Vs Component Teams

Clients will request a feature which is some sort of functionality which is useful to them. Features will almost always require code changes in multiple components. A component can be thought of as a re-usable asset which may be used to help complete a portion of one or more features. 

There are two different types of ways in which teams might organize in order to deliver software. There are feature teams and component team.

**Feature team:** this would be a a team that takes whole customer-centric features and completes them. This team would be cross-functional, containing all of the expertise needed to make code changes in one or more components to complete a feature. Because they are cross-functional, there is a reduced need to coorindate with other teams to complete a feature. After delivering a feature, the team would stick together to deliver another feature and so on.

**Component team:** this would be a team that is assembled around a particular component. While a component team could be responsible for more than one component, this team would typically be working on only front-end components or only back-end components. This type of team would be very specialized in what they are working on as a result. fffffffffffffbut would need to coordinate with other teams in order to complete a feature. Whenever someone is on a component team, it is most likely the case that the teams that their team coordinates with are also component teams.
