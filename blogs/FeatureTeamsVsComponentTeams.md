# Feature Teams Vs Component Teams

Clients will request a feature which is some sort of functionality which is useful to them. Features will almost always require code changes in multiple components. A component can be thought of as a re-usable asset which may be used to help complete a portion of one or more features. 

There are two different types of ways in which teams might organize in order to deliver software. There are feature teams and component team.

**Feature team:** this would be a a team that takes whole customer-centric features and completes them. This team would contain all of the expertise necessary to make code changes in all components necessary to complete a feature. Since features almost always require code changes in front-end and back-end, this team will need to have front-end expertise and back-end expertise. Because they are cross-functional, there is a reduced need to coorindate with other teams to complete a feature. A feature team would ideally be long-lived, completing many features together one at a time.

**Component team:** this would be a team that is assembled around particular component(s) that are used to complete part of a feature. The remainder of the feature would be completed by one or more other component teams who are also specialized in components that complete part of a feature. A component team would typically be working on only front-end components or only back-end components. Component teams will commonly work with the same components over and over again throughout multiple features. As a result, a component team will be very specialized in the work that they do.

**Feature teams vs Component teams**
For feature teams, we do not have to coordinate much with other teams so planning is significantly easier. However, feature teams have to learn quite a bit more technologies, languages, and frameworks since they are going to be making a code change in many different components. Component teams don't need to be able to work in near as many areas so they can have a more narrow focus and specialize. On the other hand, a component team has to coordinate with other component teams in order to complete features so planning is quite a bit tougher. So which route is better?
