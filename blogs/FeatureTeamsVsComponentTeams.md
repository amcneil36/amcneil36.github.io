# Feature Teams Vs Component Teams

Clients will request a feature which is some sort of functionality which is useful to them. Features will almost always require code changes in multiple components. A component can be thought of as a re-usable asset which may be used to help complete a portion of one or more features. 

There are two different types of ways in which teams might organize in order to deliver software. There are feature teams and component team.

**Feature team:** this would be a a team that takes whole customer-centric features and completes them. This team would contain all of the expertise necessary to make code changes in all components necessary to complete a feature. Since features almost always require code changes in front-end and back-end, this team would have to have front-end expertise and back-end expertise. Because they are cross-functional, there is a reduced need to coorindate with other teams to complete a feature. A feature team would ideally be long-lived, completing many features together one at a time.

**Component team:** this would be a team that is assembled around particular component(s). While a component team could be responsible for more than one component, this team would typically be working on only front-end components or only back-end components. With the component team organizational structure, multiple component teams will coordinate together to complete features with each component team taking responsibility for making changes to some of the components. Component teams will generally work with the same components over and over again throughout multiple features. As a result, a component team will be very specialized in the work that they do.
