# Feature Teams Vs Component Teams

Clients will request a feature which is some sort of functionality which is useful to them. Features will almost always require code changes in multiple components. A component can be thought of as a re-usable asset which may be used to help complete a portion of one or more features. 

There are two different types of ways in which teams might organize in order to deliver software. There are feature teams and component team.

Feature team: this would be a cross-functional team that is assembeled around making features. The team would need to have both front-end and back-end expertise so that it can make code changes in all of the necessary code changes to complete the feature. This team would be able to independently deliver a feature. After delivering a feature, the team would stick together to deliver another feature and so on.

Component team: this would be a team that is assembled around a particular component. The term 'component' in this case could mean a particular back-end component or a particular front-end component. Or, the term 'component' could even be used more broadly to just denote that this team does only front-end or only back-end. This type of team would be very specialized in what they are working in but would need to coordinate with other teams in order to complete a feature. Whenever someone is on a component team, it is most likely the case that the teams that their team coordinates with are also component teams.
