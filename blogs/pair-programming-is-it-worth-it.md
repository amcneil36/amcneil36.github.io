# Pair Programming: is it worth it?

You walk around your office and you see that most developers are sitting by themselves, doing their work. You finally spot a group of two developers working together on the same task on the same computer. In other words, they are pair programming. You stop and think to yourself-we have two people doing work that could be done by one person; wouldn't it be more efficient if we split these people up? Let's first take a look at the benefits of pair programming to see why someone might consider doing pair programming. After that, we will look at the potential downsides and see if pair programming is worth it or not.

## Higher code quality
A study performed by Dr. Laurie Williams in the year of 2000 concluded that pair programming results in 15% fewer defects.<sup>1</sup>. She believes that this is attributed to pairs considering more design alternatives, resulting in a more simple design.

## Knowledge transfer, more understanding of the code
Pair programming has the additional benefit of knowledge transfer.<sup>2</sup>

## Easier planning

## Continuous review

## Less merge conflicts
