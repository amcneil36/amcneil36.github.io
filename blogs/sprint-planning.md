## Sprint Planning
Sprint planning is typically done by doing the following:
1. Determine the team's capacity for the upcoming sprint (the amount of story points the team feels comfortable completing)
1. Select the top item off the product backlog
1. Discuss the story and break it down into tasks
1. Add the story to the sprint
1. Go back to step 2) and repeat until the team is at capacity

The team should try to fill up the sprint with enough work to be as close to being at capacity as possible without going over. Suppose that your capacity is 20 story points for this upcoming sprint. Let's say that you are in the middle of sprint planning and already have 17 story points worth of work pulled into the sprint. Furthermore, let's say that the next story off the top of the backlog that you are looking at is 4 story points. Pulling in this story would cause you to go over capacity so you don't want to do that. You should try to see if you can break down this story into 2 stories and then pull in one of the 2 stories so that you are not over capacity. If this story can't be broken down further, then you should look deeper down in the product backlog to see if there is a story that is 3 story points or less that can be pulled in. If not, it is OK to just have 17 story points signed up for in the sprint.

### Push vs Pull system
In sprint planning, the product owner will identify which work is the most important. From there, there are generally two different approaches for how sprint planning is done. One way is to use a push system in which a leader will determine who does what. Another way to decide who does what is to use a pull system where each individual team member decides which work they will do. The recommended way to do sprint planning is to use a pull system. This comes from the notion from the Agile Manifesto that teams should be self organizing. Teams are more productive and produce a higher quality product when they are self organizing.
