## Sprint Planning
Sprint planning is typically done by doing the following:
1. Determine the team's capacity for the upcoming sprint (the amount of story points the team feels comfortable completing)
1. Select the top item off the product backlog
1. Discuss the story and break it down into tasks
1. Add the story to the sprint
1. Go back to step 2) and repeat until the team is at capacity

The team should try to fill up the sprint with enough work to be as close to being at capacity as possible without going over. Suppose that your capacity is 20 story points for this upcoming sprint. Let's say that you are in the middle of sprint planning and already have 17 story points worth of work pulled into the sprint. Furthermore, let's say that the next story off the top of the backlog that you are looking at is 4 story points. Pulling in this story would cause you to go over capacity so you don't want to do that. You should try to see if you can break down this story into 2 stories and then pull in one of the 2 stories so that you are not over capacity. If this story can't be broken down further, then you should look deeper down in the product backlog to see if there is a story that is 3 story points or less that can be pulled in. If not, it is OK to just have 17 story points signed up for in the sprint.

### Push vs Pull system
In sprint planning, the product owner will identify which work is the most important. From there, there are generally two different approaches for how sprint planning is done. One way is to use a push system in which a leader will determine who does what. Another way to decide who does what is to use a pull system where each individual team member decides which work they will do. The recommended way to do sprint planning is to use a pull system. This comes from the notion from the Agile Manifesto that teams should be self organizing. Teams are more productive and produce a higher quality product when they are self organizing.

### How small should the user stories be broken down to?
In scrum, there is an emphasis on completing user stories. Code corresponding to a user story can only be released if the user story is done. We want to be completing user stories and demo'ing these completed user stories at the end of every sprint. Therefore, it is important to make sure that our user stories are small so that we feel comfortable finishing them within a sprint.

Suppose that we have one large user story that we pull into the sprint and that's it. Maybe we feel there is a 70% chance that this user story can be completed in a sprint. We either finish the user story and everyone is happy or we do not finish the user story and have nothing truly completed by the end of the sprint. This is a huge risk. We can decrease the risk by taking this large user story and breaking it down into many small user stories. This way, even if we don't finish every user story that was pulled into the sprint, we still have some user stories that were truly completed in the sprint.

So the smaller your user stories are, the more likely it is that you will have some fully completed user stories that can be demoed for feedback and optionally released. So it could be said that the smaller the user story, the better. However, we don't want to go all out making the user stories as small as possible because doing that would increase the overhead of managing the product backlog. Aiming to have the user stories be small enough such that the team completes 1-1.3 user stories per person each sprint is a good number for a two week sprint. So for a team of 7, this would mean completing 7-9 user stories each sprint.

### Should all tasks be assigned to people during sprint planning?
When it comes to when to sign up for tasks, one of three approaches are typically taken:
1. 100% of the tasks are assigned to people during sprint planning. No change in assigness are allowed.
1. 100% of the tasks are assigned to people during sprint planning. Assignees can be changed as needed throughout the sprint.
1. Each team member signs up for one task during sprint planning which is their first task. The rest of the work pulled into the sprint will be unassigned and can be picked up as people become free
