## Test-Driven-Development Recommendations
Test-Driven-Development (TDD) involves writing a failing test and then writing the implementation code needed to pass the test. Some people do TDD with unit tests. They write a failing unit test and then write the code needed to pass the test. Some people do TDD with acceptance tests where they write a failing acceptance test first and then write the code needed to pass the acceptance test (ATDD). The best way to do TDD is to use it for both acceptance tests and unit tests.<sup>a</sup> This is sometimes referred to as double loop TDD.
