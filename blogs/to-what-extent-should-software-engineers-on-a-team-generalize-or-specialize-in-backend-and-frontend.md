# To what extent should software engineers on a team generalize or specialize in the back-end and front-end?

We learned previously that scrum teams should be able to do both front-end and back-end code. But should each individual team member be able to write both front-end and back-end code?

Lets discuss 3 options for software engineers on a scrum team:
- all software engineers are equally as good at front-end as back-end
- some software engineers specialize in front-end and don't do any back-end tasks. Remaining software engineers specialize in back-end and don't do any front-end tasks
- some software engineers aim to have in-depth knowledge in front-end and broad knowledge in back-end. Remaining software engineers aim to have broad knowledge in front-end and in-depth knowledge in back-end

## Option # 1
### pros
It is very easy to do sprint planning because you can assign the tasks to just about anyone. Secondly, if one area of the project is having some issues and needs extra attention, anyone would be able to step up and do a reasonable job in helping out in that area. Teammates can also communicate well together because they have a similar understanding.

### cons
Unfortunately, this approach typically leads to lower code quality. Everyone is working in an area that they are "medium" at. No one is working in an area that they are truly great at. As a result, we don't want this approach.
