## Horizontal vs Vertical Slicing

In order to complete a feature for a customer, code changes must be made in one or more components. Most of the time, there will be more than one components. The term 'component' just refers to a re-usable asset that is used to complete a portion of a feature. The front-end and back-end are both considered components. Within the back-end there could be multiple components such as a data retrieval component and a data insertion component. So the term 'component' could be used at different levels of granularity.

When planning out a project, there are two different approaches that teams might take to plan out the order of the work to be done. One approach is **horizontal slicing** where a team will attempt to complete all work in one component before moving on to another component. This might involve trying to do the whole back-end before starting the back-end. It might involve trying to do the whole front-end before starting the back-end. Or, it might involve completing one component in the back-end and then completing one component in the front-end followed by returning to the back-end. The second approach is **vertical slicing** where a team will code up a portion of multiple components at a time in order to produce a small amount of end to end functionality.
