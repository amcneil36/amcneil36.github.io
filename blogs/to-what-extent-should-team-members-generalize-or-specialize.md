# To what extent should team members generalize or specialize?

Lets imagine we have a scrum team containing some software engineers, a business analyst, and a tester. Maybe the team contains a few other roles too or maybe it doesn't. The answer to this question is going to be the same in either case so do not worry if this example mirrors the set up on your team.

Lets discuss three different options that might represent a team members skill set.

**Generalist:** this would be a team member that is equally good in many areas.

**Specialist:** this would be a team member that is extremely strong in one or two areas and does not do any work outside of their specialization.

**Generalizing-Specialist:** this would be a team member that has in-depth skills in one or two areas and broad skills in other areas. This person would attempt to primarily work in their specializtion but would be more than willing to work in an area outside of their specialization if needed. These people are sometimes called T-shaped people.

## Generalist
### pros
It is very easy to do sprint planning because you can assign the tasks to just about anyone. Secondly, if one area of the project is having some issues and needs extra attention, anyone would be able to step up and do a reasonable job in helping out in that area. Teammates can also communicate well together because they have a similar understanding.

### cons
Unfortunately, this approach typically leads to lower code quality. Everyone is working in an area that they are "medium" at. No one is working in an area that they are truly great at. If we were in a situation in which a random number is generated to determine which software engineer does which software engineering task, then having software engineers being a generalist would make sense. But because software engineers can choose which task they want to do, it is more efficient to allow for specialization within software engineers and attempt to have them prioritize towards choosing tasks that suit their specialization. For someone who is a business analyst or tester, the same argument would apply. There may or may not be as much choosing of their tasks in comparison to software engineers but they would still want their specializations to mirror what they work on more frequently. As a result, we don't want this option for any of the roles.

## Specialist
## pros
Team members are only working in areas that they are specialized in so they don't need near as much time to be onboarded. After getting onboarded, team members also don't need near as much time doing spikes and other types of studying. Team members would also be more likely to understand best practices in the area(s) they are working in since they only work in areas they are specialized in.

## cons
This setup makes it difficult to remove bottlenecks. If something is going wrong in a particular area, we might want to have more than one person help out in that area. If people are all specialists, we may not be able to have more than one person to help out so having specialists makes bottlenecks take longer to remove. Secondly, some sprints might contain works that require a little bit different skill sets than other sprints. This means that in some sprints, our specialist set up aligns well with the work that needs to be done but in other sprints the specialist set up does not align well with the work that needs to be done. Lastly, when a specialist is out of office, it might be hard for someone else to cover their area.

## Generalizing-Specialist
## pros
A majority of the work being done by a team member is in an area that they are specialized in. This set up also still has the ability for multiple people to step up and remove bottlenecks since they contain broad skills in many areas.

## cons
Team members will sometimes work in areas that they have broad skills in which might be a scenario where best practices are followed quite as well in comparison to having people only work in areas they are specialized in. Secondly, it could also be the case that some sprints result in requiring skills that align well with the generalizing-specialist set up and other sprints require skills that do not align well with the generalizing-specialist setup.

Here's the bottom line. It's good to have a software engineer specialize in an area and prioritize giving them tasks in that area. But the software engineer needs to be able to step up and work on tasks in an area outside of their specialization. Imagine a user story is 70% complete and the sprint is about to end. All that is left is some front-end code but back-end is your main specialization. You need to be able to step up and help out in the front-end to finish the end of the sprint. Or imagine there is a front-end task that is blocked by a back-end task. As someone who is a specialist in front-end, you still need to be able to step up and help with the back-end to help remove blockages. Being able to step up and remove bottlenecks is what separates this option from option 2. As a result, this is the best option.

---------------------------
note this applies to all teammates
at some times, certain areas of the project are more important (we need back-end help)
if your a front-end specialist, you would end up continuing with front-end tasks and get ahead of the back-end code
whoever is writing requiremetns needs to be able to do other stuff because getting ahead on requirements is no good
same for the tester-trying to write test cases for stuff that is not near ready to be started is waste
make decisions at the last responsible moment
what about having a specialist that works on multiple teams?
