## How much upfront design should be done before coding?
I have seen teams with a large amount of variance in the amount of design they do upfront before coding. Some teams will do big design up front where they try to do all of the high-level and low-level design before coding. In this situation, they are trying to 'get it right' the first time in order to avoid rework. Some teams will do no design before coding. They just jump into coding, get something working, and then refactor. Others will do what is referred to more as "just enough design upfront" where they might do just enough high-level design before coding. After they get something working, they would refactor. To some degree, this is a question of spending more time doing design and less time doing refactoring versus spending less time doing design and more time doing refactoring. Lets take a look at these options individually.
