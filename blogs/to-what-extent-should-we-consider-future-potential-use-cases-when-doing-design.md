## To what extent should we consider future potential use cases when doing design?
Suppose there are many user stories in the product backlog for a product that you are working on. You are about to start doing design for one of the user stories now. There are a few ways you can do the design for your user story. Should you only look at your user story and do design that is optimal for only your user story? Should you try to do your desgin for your user story in such a way that the other user stories in the product backlog will be easier? Should we take it one step further and try to do our design such that future potential user stories that we haven't came up yet will be easier? In most cases, this is a question of how generic and re-usable our code should be. In other cases, it is a question of which scenarios our code should account for. There are two different approaches that come to mind when thinking about this.

### Coding for now
In this scenario, we write just enough code to meet the current requirements. We do not spend any time trying to make our code work for potential future use-cases that we don't currently have. We don't attempt to make our code any more generic than needed to solve the current problem we have. If there is a scenario that we are unsure as to whether or not we will need to account for in the future, we don't account for it right now. If we find out later that we do need to account for that scenario, then we will add the code to account for that scenario then.

### Coding for the future
In this scenario, we try to brainstorm future potential use-cases and make our code generic enough to account for them. This would include doing more code than what the current requirements would need. We spend extra time doing design early on in hopes that it will save time in the future.
