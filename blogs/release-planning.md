## Release Planning

Releasing is the only thing that adds value to the customer so it makes sense to have some planning done on the release level. This is known as release planning. Release planning for new project generally involves planning 3-6 months of work. When planning a release, there are tradeoffs that need to be considered such as scope, date, and cost. It can almost always be expected that some things won't go according to plan so we need to have some sort of flexibility in our release plan to account for this. If we try to fix scope and date, we generally don't have enough room to make adjustments for when we get behind schedule. Adding humans late in a project makes the project later so having a flexible cost for the project doesn't do as much help as one might think. So in order to have enough flexibility for when something goes wrong, we need scope or date flexible. This leads us to the two most common ways to release plan which is to plan a fixed scope release or a fixed date release.

### Fixed Scope Release
In the fixed scope release, we end up with a release plan that includes the functionality we want to include in the next release. There will likely be a date range where all of this functionality is predicted to be finished by but the actual date of the release will just be whenever everything is done. If the work takes longer than predicted, we end up just releasing at a later date.

### Fixed Date Release
In the fixed date release, we end up with a release plan that has a date for when we want to release. There will be some functionality included on the release plan but it would be negotiable. Unlike the fixed scope release, the fixed date release will sometimes fix cost. If we have a release date, we can fix cost by simply not allocating more resources than originally planned.

Release Planning
	• For new projects this is generally planning 3-6 months of work. 
	• Since releasing is the only thing that adds value, it makes sense to have some sort of planning around releases
	• Fixed scope release
		○ Bad because market could change or customer could change their mind
	• Fixed date release
		○ Allows for negotiable scope
	-which ones is better
	• How to plan a fixed date release
		○ Determine if your release will be an mvp or mmf
			§ Mvp = release done with least amount of effort needed to learn something
			§ Mmf = smallest amount of features that deliver significant value to the customer
		○ Add up the number of story points this entails
		○ Add another 25-40% more story points of work depending on risk, uncertainty, and consequences of not meeting the deadline. 
		○ Choose a release date based on the amount of story points this sums up to and your velocity
	• Do not make assumptions about who will do what
	• How flexible is the release plan?
		○ Not very
		○ Can be changed every sprint
	• Whole team works on the next release
		○ Some peeps might get pulled into defects
		○ Otherwise don't need to be working on two different releases unless your team is large at which point your team can be broken down further
