## Additional Scrum Recommendations
In this blog post, I'll include small tidbits of information useful for Scrum.

### Sprint goal
Each sprint should have a sprint goal which is the goal of what you want to accomplish this sprint.

### Daily Standup
In the daily standup, you should talk about progress you made towards the sprint goal yesterday, progress you plan to make towards the sprint goal today, and anything that is blocking you from helping accomplish the sprint goal. Any work that you did that was not part of the sprint goal does not need to be mentioned at the daily standup.

### Sprint length
Sprints are generally 2-4 weeks in length. I tend to prefer the 2 week sprint the most. It is also the most common sprint length that teams go with. The longer the sprint is, the harder it is to come u with sprint plans that are likely to hold up. 

### Demos
Team members should spend no more than 2 hours each sprint preparing for the demos. Demos are intentionally held informally to make sure that team members have more time to work on the tasks that they pulled into the sprint.

Team members should only demo user stories that satisfy the team's definition of done. This should be some sort of end to end functionality where the team members can start the application and show something of value to customers. Some teams will attempt to demo some partially complete funcdtionality where they kick off some test from the back-end. Or maybe they demo the design. Don't do this. Only demo completed end to end functionality that can be expressed in terms of business value and can be functionally understood by customers.

### Product Backlog
The product backlog needs to be sorted by priority with the highest priority items on the top. This way the team can primarily just look at the top of the backlog to see which work is about to be worked on.

The further down the product backlog, the less sense it makes to break down the product backlog item (PBI). This is because when the PBI is farther away from being worked on, there is more time that will pass by until then at which point the market could change, the customer could change their mind, or some earlier PBI's that this PBI depends on got coded up in a different way which changes how this PBI needs to be done. So trying to break down a PBI that is farther out could result in a lot of your time going to waste.

We should have one backlog for each product so it is easy to see which work we should work on at any point of time.

### Sprint planning
Use a pull system where team members get to decide which tasks to sign up for.

Leave most of the tasks in sprint planning unassigned. Since some tasks may take longer or shorter than predicted, we want for anyone to be able to pick up tasks as needed.
