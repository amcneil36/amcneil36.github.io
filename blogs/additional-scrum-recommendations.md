## Additional Scrum Recommendations
In this blog post, I'll include random tidbits of information useful for Scrum that weren't discussed in any of my other blog posts.

### Sprint goal
Each sprint should have a sprint goal which is the goal of what you want to accomplish this sprint.

### Daily Standup
In the daily standup, you should talk about progress you made towards the sprint goal yesterday, progress you plan to make towards the sprint goal today, and anything that is blocking you from helping accomplish the sprint goal. Any work that you did that was not part of the sprint goal does not need to be mentioned at the daily standup.

### Sprint length
Sprints are generally 2-4 weeks in length. I tend to prefer the 2 week sprint the most. It is also the most common sprint length that teams go with. The longer the sprint is, the harder it is to come u with sprint plans that are likely to hold up. 

### Demos
Team members should spend no more than 2 hours each sprint preparing for the demos. Demos are intentionally held informally to make sure that team members have more time to work on the tasks that they pulled into the sprint.

Team members should only demo user stories that satisfy the team's definition of done. This should be some sort of end to end functionality where the team members can start the application and show something of value to customers. Some teams will attempt to demo some partially complete funcdtionality where they kick off some test from the back-end. Or maybe they demo the design. Don't do this. Only demo completed end to end functionality that can be expressed in terms of business value and can be functionally understood by customers.
