## Professionalism
In this post, I'll give some tidbits I learned from books on how to be professional in a corporate environment.

### Asserting your dominance
Never try to assert your dominance. You do not need to go around telling people things such as "I am the smartest person on the team" or "I know way more than ___ " or "___ doesn't know anything." If you want others to view you as someone who is good at your job, simply be good at your job.

Admin when you don't know something and ask questions when needed. Some people don't like to ask questions or admit they don't know something because they think it will make them look less smart.
