## Social Skills
Improving your social skills is very important in a corporate environment. In this post I'll make some recommendations for how to socialize in office and make friends.

### Building up confidence to speak to others
The best way to build up confidence when speaking to others is to start small and work your way up. You can start off by just nodding your head and smiling when you walk by others. Once you get good at that, you can improve to telling people "good morning" when you walk by them in the morning. After that, you can ask people how they are doing. The more comfortable you get, the longer the conversations you can try to have.
