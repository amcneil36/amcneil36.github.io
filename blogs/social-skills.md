## Social Skills
Improving your social skills is very important in a corporate environment. In this post I'll make some recommendations for how to socialize in office and make friends.

### Building up confidence to speak to others
The best way to build up confidence when speaking to others is to start small and work your way up. You can start off by just nodding your head and smiling when you walk by others. Once you get good at that, you can improve to telling people "good morning" when you walk by them in the morning. After that, you can ask people how they are doing. The more comfortable you get, the longer the conversations you can try to have.

### How to make a positive impression on others during conversation
People really like to talk about themselves. Ask people about themself and let them talk about themself. They should be talking about themself for more than half of the conversation. Also show that you are a good listener.

Another thing that is good to do is to say the person's name as you are talking to them. People like to hear their name. You can say "hey ___ how are you doing?" followed by "that is very interesting ___ ." This will also help you remember the person's name after you are done talking to them.
