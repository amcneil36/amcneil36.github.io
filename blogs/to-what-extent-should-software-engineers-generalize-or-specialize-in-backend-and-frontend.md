# To what extent should software engineers generalize or specialize in the back-end and front-end?

We learned previously that scrum teams should be able to do both front-end and back-end code. But should each individual team member be able to write both front-end and back-end code?

Lets discuss 3 options for software engineers on a scrum team:
- each software engineer aims to be equally good at front-end as back-end
- some software engineers specialize in front-end and some software engineers specialize in back-end. Software Engineers will only work in their specialization
- some software engineers aim to have in-depth knowledge in front-end and medium-depth knowledge in back-end. Other software engineers aim to have medium knowledge in front-end and in-depth knowledge in back-end
