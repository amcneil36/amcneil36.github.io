## When should a component team be used?
We previously talked about [why we should favor using feature teams over component teams](https://amcneil36.github.io/blogs/feature-teams-vs-component-teams-which-one-is-better). However, we didn't establish that component teams should be completely avoided. We just established that we should we should use feature teams for most scenarios. So when should component teams be used?

Suppose your team needs code changes made in some component that it has never used before. There are two different setups we could have:
1. feature team setup where our team will make code changes in the component
2. component team setup where a component team will make code changes in the component

In the feature team setup, there is an overhead of having to learn about the component before making code changes to it.
