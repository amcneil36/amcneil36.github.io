## How to prepare for and give presentations
This blog post is going to cover my recommendations for how to go about preparing for and giving a presentation, presumably in front of a decent amount of people. Almost everyone feels at least a little uncomfortable getting up in front of a large group of people to give a presentation. If you see a lot of people giving presentations and you do not feel that the presenters are nervous, think about the following:
1. Some speakers might be nervous but do a better job at hiding it than others  
1. Suppose the average comfort level of presenters that you have watched is 5/10. This does not mean that the average person has a comfort level of 5/10 when presenting. Most people who are giving presentations have volunteered to do so. People who are less comfortable presenting are less likely to volunteer to present. The average person is going to be quite a bit less comfortable giving presentations than the average person who volunteers to give a presentation.

So if you feel very uncomfortable about presenting, you probably aren't near as much uncomfortable relative to other people as you might think. Even if you happen to be pretty uncomfortable relative to others, there are still many things you can do to become more comfortable at giving presentations. We will talk about those.

### Preparing for the presentation
You should view the presentation you are giving as a conversation with the audience. You have studied a topic that interests you and you are interested to have a conversation with others on the topic. That's it. Let's talk about how to prepare the powerpoint.

Create an outline before polishing your presentation. If you try to polish first, you risk needing to throw away a lot of your work in the event that you change your mind about which points you want to make. Your outline can start out as
* Introduction
* Motiveation
* Takeaways (main point, meat of the talk)
* Conclusion (re-hash of takeaways, optionally give audience an action item)  

For your title slide, you want to include your name, contact information, website, talk name, event name, and date. You can create an appendix at the end of your presentation if you want to give additional information.

If you know anyone who will be in attendance, ask them what they want to get out of the presentation. This information can help you make a presentation that will do a better job covering areas that the audience might be interested in. Depending on what extent you cover these areas, this information may also help reveal what the future questions in the Q&A session are going to be.

The more uncomfortable you feel about giving the presentation, the more you should practice giving the presentation. Give your presentation out loud when you are practicing to better simulate the real environment. 

You should avoid trying to memorize the presentation that you are giving. Instead, you should be able to talk freely as you are giving the presentation. The only exception to this is the first portion of your presentation. You should memorize the first 10-15 seconds of the presentation because this part is usually toughest on people's nerves.

When it is closer to the day of the presentation, practice giving a presentation in the room that you will be presenting in. One reason for doing this is to make sure that you are comfortable with the technology and getting your computer screen projected on the wall. Another reason that this will give more valuable practice reps since the practice is being done in the same room that the presentation will be given in.

### The day of the presentation
#### Before the presentation starts
Show up early so you have some time to get the technology set up and can call someone if the technology isn't working. 

Around ten minutes before starting the presentation, walk down to the people in the front row and start having a conversation with them. Ask them what they want to get out of the presentation to again help reveal what might be asked in the Q&A session. Unlike when you asked this question many days ago, this time you don't need to change your presentation to account for what they want to get out of the presentation. Changing your presentation ten minutes before giving it generally does more harm than good. 

#### During the presentation
When giving the presentation, your body language should be open. You do not want to cross your arms, put your hands in your pockets, or hide behind your desk. You especially don't want to be turning your back to the audience.  You should primarily be looking into the audience and not looking at your computer screen. If you are presenting in a large auditorium, look 2/3 of the way deep and towards the center. You should also be able to walk around freely as you are presenting.

If the technology starts messing up in the middle of the presentation, do an ice breaker while the technology person is fixing the technology. Ask people where they came from or if they have any questions so far. If it has been a few minutes and the technology still hasn't been fixed, you can communicate that you will give the presentation without the slides.

#### During the Q&A session at the end
At the end of the presentation is the Q&A session. This is something many presenters are uncomfortable about because they are concerned that someone might ask a question that they don't know how to answer. It is understandable to have this concern. In fact, it would be completely normal for anyone out there giving a presentation to receive a question they don't know the answer to. This is part of the reason why I recommended to ask people ahead of time what they want to get out of the presentation. This gives you a few questions to go ahead and prepare for. In addition to that, you can try to brainstorm other potential questions that people might ask.

However, there is always a chance that you will get asked a question you are unsure of no matter how much you prepare and that is OK. If you get asked a question you are unsure of, you can communicate that you are unsure and can ask the audience if any of them would like to take a stab at it. Maybe someone in the audience is truly knowledgeable about the area that the question was asked in. This could start an interesting conversation between members of the audience. Asking the audience only is an option if it's more of a general question. For example, if you are presenting on something your team did and someone asks something about your team, you probably can't ask the audience about that unless there are team members of yours in the audience. If asking the audience result in anyone replying or you aren't able to ask the audience to begin with, then the last thing you can do is to communicate that you are unsure but you will research it afterwards and get back to them.

Sometimes you will get asked a complicated question that you know the answer to but it will take extremely long to explain and there is not sufficient time for the explanation. In that scenario, you can request that the person who asked the question come up to you afterwards when the Q&A session is done and people are filing out.

		
	slowly build confidence up through presenting in front of larger people
	how to build confidence. work your way up presenting in front of more people. start with decent number of words on your slides and then slowly take some down. having a lot of slides makes people read your slides and not listen to you
