## How to prepare for and give presentations
This blog post is going to cover my recommendations for how to go about preparing for and giving a presentation, presumably in front of a decent amount of people. Almost everyone feels at least a little uncomfortable getting up in front of a large group of people to give a presentation. If you see a lot of people giving presentations and you do not feel that the presenters are nervous, think about the following:
1. Some speakers might be nervous but do a better job at hiding it than others  
1. Suppose the average comfort level of presenters that you have watched is 5/10. This does not mean that the average person has a comfort level of 5/10 when presenting. Most people who are giving presentations have volunteered to do so. People who are less comfortable presenting are less likely to volunteer to present. The average person is going to be quite a bit less comfortable giving presentations than the average person who volunteers to give a presentation.

So if you feel very uncomfortable about presenting, you probably aren't near as much uncomfortable relative to other people as you might think. Even if you happen to be pretty uncomfortable relative to others, there are still many things you can do to become more comfortable at giving presentations. We will talk about those.

### How to prepare for giving a presentation
You should view the presentation you are giving as a conversation with the audience. You have studied a topic that interests you and you are interested to have a conversation with others on the topic. Other people can give you their take on the topic and you can learn together.



	• view the presentation as a conversation
	• create an outline before polishing
	• Outline:
		○ Introduction
		○ Motivation
		○ Takeaways (main points, the meat of the talk)
		○ Conclusion-re-hash takeaways, give audience an action item
	• Title slide includes your name, contact information, website, talk name, event name, date
	• Create appendix if you want to give additional information
	• If you know anyone who will be in attendance, ask them what they want to get out of the presentation
	• Practice your presentation many times
	• don't memorize the presentation
		○ only memorize the first 10 - 15 seconds of the presentation because that is the toughest on people's nerves
	• practice giving a presentation in the room days in advance if possible
	• When presenting
		○ We want body language to be open, not closed. This can be done through body language, eye contact, walking, tone.
		○ Do not cross your arms, put hands in your pockets, or hide behind a computer/desk
		○ make direct eye contact with peeps. if many people then look 2/3 of the way deep and towards the center
		○ do not look at the slides much when presenting
		○ We want to be able to walk around freely
		○ If you don't know the answer to a question someone asks, you can ask the crowd. If someone asks a really complicated question, you can tell them to see you afterwards
	slowly build confidence up through presenting in front of larger people
when something going wrong with technology and a tech person is fixing it, ask people stuff like where they traveled from
