## How to prepare for and give presentations
This blog post is going to cover my recommendations for how to go about preparing for and giving a presentation, presumably in front of a decent amount of people. Almost everyone feels a little uncomfortable getting up in front of a large group of people to give a presentation. If you see a lot of people giving presentations and do not feel that the presenters are nervous, think about the following:
1. Some speakers might be nervous but do a better job at hiding it than others  
1. Most people who give presentations have volunteered to do so. People who are less comfortable presenting

	• view the presentation as a conversation
	• create an outline before polishing
	• Outline:
		○ Introduction
		○ Motivation
		○ Takeaways (main points, the meat of the talk)
		○ Conclusion-re-hash takeaways, give audience an action item
	• Title slide includes your name, contact information, website, talk name, event name, date
	• Create appendix if you want to give additional information
	• If you know anyone who will be in attendance, ask them what they want to get out of the presentation
	• Practice your presentation many times
	• don't memorize the presentation
		○ only memorize the first 10 - 15 seconds of the presentation because that is the toughest on people's nerves
	• practice giving a presentation in the room days in advance if possible
	• When presenting
		○ We want body language to be open, not closed. This can be done through body language, eye contact, walking, tone.
		○ Do not cross your arms, put hands in your pockets, or hide behind a computer/desk
		○ make direct eye contact with peeps. if many people then look 2/3 of the way deep and towards the center
		○ do not look at the slides much when presenting
		○ We want to be able to walk around freely
		○ If you don't know the answer to a question someone asks, you can ask the crowd. If someone asks a really complicated question, you can tell them to see you afterwards
when something going wrong with technology and a tech person is fixing it, ask people stuff like where they traveled from
