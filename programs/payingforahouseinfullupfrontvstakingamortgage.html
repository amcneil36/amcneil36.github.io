 alert("For someone who has enough money to pay for a house in full as well as a job that allows them to pay monthly mortgage fees should they choose to go the mortgage route, this calculator calculates whether paying for a house in full vs taking a mortgage will make more money in the long run. Taking the mortgage route always results in more money spent on the house because of interest. However, taking a mortgage allows you to place more money in investments in the short term since you end up doing a down payment instead of paying in full for the house up-front. Paying in full for the house allows you to place more money into investments in the long term but most of that money will have had less time to grow in comparison to the money placed in investments from having gone the mortgage route. So is paying in full up-front or taking a mortgage more profitable in the long-run? That depends primarily on the interest rate of the mortgage and the predicted return rate on the investments. This calculator will tell you which route will result in more money in the long run (the time at which the mortgage would have been paid off).");
