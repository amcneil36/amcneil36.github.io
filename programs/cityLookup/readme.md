This tool is used to help someone find cities that they might be interested in moving to.
Instead of entering in a city you are interested in and then finding out weather/demographics information for that city, you enter in weather/demographics information that you are interested in and then this tool will generate a list of all cities/towns/CDPs in the USA that satisfy that criteria.

For example, if you want to see a list of all places in the USA that have a december high greater than 50F and an august high less than 86F, you can do that with this tool.

This tool does let you enter in a city if you are only interested in seeing results for that city but that's not really the way that this tool is intended to be used.
