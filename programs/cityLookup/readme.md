This tool is used to find which cities you might be interested in moving to.

Instead of entering in a city you are interested in and then finding out weather/demographics information for that city, you enter in weather/demographics information that you are interested in and then this tool will generate a list of all cities/towns/CDPs in the USA that satisfy that criteria.

For example, here is how it would look if you want to generate a list of all cities in the USA that have a population greater than 10000, average August High less than 86F, average December high greater than 50F, and an average annual rainfall less than 48 inches:

This tool does let you enter in a city if you are only interested in seeing results for that city but that's not really the way that this tool is intended to be used.
