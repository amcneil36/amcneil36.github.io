
## City lookup
This tool is used to find which cities you might be interested in moving to.

Instead of entering in a city you are interested in and then finding out weather/demographics information for that city, you enter in weather/demographics information that you are interested in and then this tool will generate a list of all cities/towns/CDPs in the USA that satisfy that criteria.

For example, here is how it would look if you want to generate a list of all cities in the USA that have a population greater than 10000, average August High less than 86F, average December high greater than 50F, and an average annual rainfall less than 48 inches:

This tool does let you enter in a city if you are only interested in seeing results for that city but that's not really the way that this tool is intended to be used since there are many websites already out there that work that way.
